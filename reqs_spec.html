							<h2 id="mission-stmt">Requirements Specification</h2>
							<div class="MuiBox-root css-m507i9">
								<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-lj8hfv">Our requirements were refined by a process of data gathering, analysis, and synthesis. We developed functional requirements that define the functions the application should perform, data requirements that define the data that the app should store and manipulate, non-functional requirements that define attributes of the app, and hardware/software requirements that define what we know of what hardware the app will need to be able to run on and what software the app will need to run with.</p>
								<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-lj8hfv">We ranked these requirements from 1 to 5 in order of importance. Our level 1 requirements are our Minimum Viable Product; Cognizant determined that our MVP is making the profile repository searchable so all our searching functions are level 1.
								Our level 2 requirements are things that we expect to also be able to finish, but are less essential. Levels 3 and 4 are for features that would be nice to have but are not a huge priority, and level 5 would define features that are being documented for 
							later iterations of the project. </p>
