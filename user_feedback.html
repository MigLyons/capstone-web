						<h1>User Feedback</h1>
					
						<p>The interviews, lasting 20-30 minutes each, were conducted and recorded via Microsoft Teams. During each session, one member of the Snow Leopard team led the interview and asked questions, while another team member took detailed notes, particularly focusing on the interviewee's responses. The interviews either utilized one of the two sets of questions tailored for different roles: one for team leads and one for consultants. The specific question set used depended on the interviewee’s role to ensure alignment with their responsibilities. </p>

						<h2>Method</h2>
						<p>    We gathered client feedback to identify specific concerns from end users and explore potential implementation features to enhance their experience. Using these insights, we developed an online questionnaire, which was completed by various Team Leads and Consultants at Cognizant. </p>

						<h2>Sample Questions</h2>
						<h3>Interview</h3>
						<p>Consultants</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i>What methods do you use to get staffed on a project? </i></li>
							<li><i>Can you identify frustrations or obstacles you face with the Consultant-Project matching process as a Consultant?</i></li>
							<li><i>Have you experienced periods of not being staffed on enough projects? How did you resolve this issue?</i></li>
							<li><i>Can you identify frustrations or obstacles you face when creating or updating your consultant profile?</i></li>
						</ul>
						<p>Team Leads</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i>What methods do you use to find consultants?</i></li>
							<li><i>Can you identify frustrations or obstacles you face with the Consultant-Project matching process as a Team Lead?</i></li>
							<li><i>What section of a consultant's profile do you find most useful for assessing their fitness for a project?</i></li>
							<li><i>Do you have any pet peeves or things that bother you when you’re reading profiles</i></li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Questionnaire</h3>
						<p>The questionnaire featured a variety of questions, including both scale ratings and multiple-choice options. Examples of both include:</p>
						<h4>Scale Ratings</h4>
						<p>Consultants</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i>Do you think an AI based tool to help refine profiles would help or hinder the Consultant-Project matching process?</i></li>
							<li><i>How would you rate a profile's ability to convey your skills and expertise?</i></li>
						</ul>
						<p>Team Leads</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i>How difficult would you rate the process to staff a project?</i></li>
							<li><i>How comfortable are you with the profile sharepoint repository?</i></li>
							<li><i>Would an AI based tool to search profiles and to help consultants refine their profiles would help or hinder the Consultant-Project matching process?</i></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Multiple Choice</h4>
						<p>Consultants</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i>Which subsection of the profile is the HARDEST for you to fill out?</i></li>
							<li><i>Which subsection of the profile is the EASIEST for you to fill out?</i></li>
							<li><i>Have you experienced any of the following frustrations or obstacles when getting matched to a project?</i></li>
						</ul>
						<p>Team Leads</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i>Have you experienced these frustrations or obstacles when attempting to staff a project?</i></li>
							<li><i>What section of a consultant's profile do you find most useful for assessing their fitness for a project?</i></li>
							<li><i>What searching features could we implement to improve the Consultant-Project matching process?</i></li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Key Insights</h2>

						<p>
							<b>1. Consultants find it difficult to fit everything into their profile.</b><br>
							A key insight from this graph is that a significant number of consultants (54.8%) find it challenging to "fit everything" into their profile, while 51.6% struggle to "describe project experience effectively." This suggests that consultants are finding it difficult to capture the full scope of their skills and project contributions within the current profile template, indicating a need for a more flexible or detailed format that allows for comprehensive self-representation.

						<p><b>2. Team Leads find it difficult in finding consultants with specific technical experience.</b><br>
							A key insight from this data is that the difficulty in finding consultants with specific technical experience is a common frustration for those tasked with staffing projects. Additionally, the data shows that a keyword search or filtering functionality based on specific skills (example: "Javascript" in Technical Expertise) could make the SharePoint profile repository more useful and encourage its usage. This suggests a need for improved search and filtering capabilities within the repository, to streamline the consultant-project matching process and reduce reliance on word-of-mouth recommendations.
